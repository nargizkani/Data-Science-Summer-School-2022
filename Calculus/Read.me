Outline of the Course:
• Analysis in R: the real line, and sequences
• Calculus in R: limits, continuity, differentiation (definition and basic rules, derivatives of elementary functions, monotonicity, higher-order derivatives), 
and integration (indefinite integrals as antiderivatives, integration by parts and by substitution, definite integrals)
• Unconstrained optimization in R: existence of optima, first-order conditions, secondorder conditions
• Calculus in R: real-valued functions of several real variables, limits, continuity, differentiation (partial derivatives, directional derivatives, Hessian), and 
multiple integrals.
